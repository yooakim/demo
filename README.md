# Demo Web 

This is our _go-to_ demo Web App app built on the recent Microsoft technologoy stack. This demo project uses:

* [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) - a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications
* .NET Framework Core
* [Razor Pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages/index?tabs=visual-studio) - is a new feature of ASP.NET Core MVC that makes coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive.
 
## Deploying the app

As this app is built using [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/) it can run on all plattforms the [.NET Core runtime supports](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/all).

More information about how to deploy can be found [here](./docs/HOWTO-Deploy.md)
